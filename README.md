# About Dormdash

At the end of each semester, students need to vacate their housing for the break. Many students at CBU end up discarding perfectly good furniture and items in the dumpster. During this period, it’s common for Resident Assistants (RAs) and other students to visit the dumpsters, even climbing in, to check for usable items. This app is designed to address this issue by providing a more organized and sustainable solution.


# Primary App Feature

The app’s core functionality is to enable students to donate or sell their unwanted items. By creating a digital platform for listing and browsing items, students can easily find new homes for their furniture and belongings instead of resorting to dumping them. This feature promotes sustainability, reduces waste, and fosters a sense of community among students.
